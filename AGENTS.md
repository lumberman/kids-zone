# Kids Zone Agents Guide

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Project conventions
- Keep the app build-free: all features must run from static HTML/CSS/JS.
- Prefer vanilla JavaScript and browser APIs; avoid heavy dependencies.
- Persist user data locally using `localStorage` only.
- Keep accessibility in mind (large tap targets, readable type).

## UX goals
- Favor calm, kid-friendly visuals and clear step-by-step flows.
- Ensure actions work offline after the first load.
